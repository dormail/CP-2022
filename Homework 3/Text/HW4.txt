PROBLEM 1. BUFFON’S NEEDLE AND
MEASURING PI
“Buffon’s needle problem” is a question, originally
posed by Comte de Buffon in 1733;
Suppose we have a floor made of parallel
strips of wood, each the same width, and we
drop a needle onto the floor. What is the
probability that the needle will lie across a
line between two strips?

PROBLEM 2. INTERACTING DYNAMIC
SPINS
Consider a system of “two fixed but freely rotating spins” with magnetic moment with interaction in
3-dimension.
This problem is one of very early example of integral geometry, and currently widely used in example of Monte Carlo studies. For convenience, assume length of needle

The corresponding Hamiltonian will be written as

does not.
is the same as distance between strips. The probability
that the needle is placed across the strips is given as,

The probability of phase space point is proportional to
Boltzmann factor, we can get a probability distribution
and calculate desired parameters.

Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) studied in
class, calculate the following measures numerically. Let2

PROBLEM 3. PHASE TRANSITION IN
2-DIMENSIONAL ISING MODEL
Suppose a periodic 2-dimsional lattice with lateral
length L. (therefore total L2 sites within.) At each site,
identical spin with value si ∈ {−1, 1} is occupied. Each
spin interacts with neighbor spins with energy −Jsi sj
and temperature T = 1/β, therefore overall Hamiltonian
reads

H {s1 , ..., si } = −J

j∈N(i)
where set of spins {N(i)} is a neighbor set of spin si . The
main observable of this system will be spin per site M ,
energy per site E, and order parameters magnetization

Where angled bracket means ensemble average, which
average is average over sample with weight corresponding
to probability. Note that energy per site is divided by 2
to compensate double-counting.
Now, you will observe phase transition of this system
with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Naive ensemble average (or, full-counting average) takes a lots of
computation, due to involving too much irrelevant (less
probable; such as all-up configuration) configurations.
Using what we learned in class, you will construct a
set of samples (or, ensemble) to calculate above order
parameters.
Procedure
Setup
1) Define system parameters.
(number of spins N ,
Interaction strength βJ). Choose basic system size L
suitable to your computer speed. Typical selection will
be around L ∼ 30 Also, choose appropriate temperature
near the transition temperature Tc
2) Allocate initial configuration. Typical choice will be
assigning up/down randomly.
Collecting Ensembles
1) From a configuration, randomly flip a single spin,
and calculate acceptance ratio. You may use either
Metropolis choice or Gibbs choice of acceptance.
2) If accepted, use accepted spin configuration. If not,
use current configuration.
3) Calculate the observables.
4) Repeat 1-3) multiple times to collect many ensembles
as you can. Note that the system needs to be “stabilized”, so you need burn-in process to ensure this state
is in stationary state.
Measurement
1) For fixed size L, calculate order parameters |M |2 , CV
for various temperature.
2) Do the upper calculation for system with length
L, 2L, 3L.
Problems
A) Plot some of the spin configuration for different
temperature, with largest system size. Can you see the
domain formed?
B) Plot |M |2 (T, N ) by T . Draw multiple lines for
N . Can you see phase transition? If so, what is its
characteristics?
Suggest a method to calculate its
critical exponents. Discuss what we can observe from
characteristcs of different system size.
C) Plot CV (T, N ) by T .
N . Same as above.
Draw multiple lines for
D) Do the same approach above in hexagonal lattice. (also known as Honeycomb lattice) Does the phase
transition character changes about lattice structure?
