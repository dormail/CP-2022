\section{Generating fractal with probabilistic iteration}
\label{sec:exercise-2}

\subsection{Generating a fractal and rebuilding one}
I reproduced the fractal in \autoref{fig:fractal}.

\subsection{Measuring fractal dimension}
Luckily the fractals are embedded in a 2D-Surface so we can use the box counting method. With the box counting method,
the whole surface gets covered with $N$ boxes to approximate the surface of the fractal. In an iteration the boxes are
made smaller and $N$ gets raised. If you have a nice, well behaving two dimensional object, doubling $N$ (so splitting
boxes in half) results in approximately double the amount of boxes filled. With a fractal however, this can be any
number. In \autoref{fig:fractal-dimension} this can be seen for the given fractal.

\subsection{Doing the same again for my own fractal}
Now we repeat and see the result: A beautiful smear of blue color in \autoref{fig:my_fractal}. The dimension is the
same as the analysis in \autoref{fig:my_fractal-dimension} suggests.
